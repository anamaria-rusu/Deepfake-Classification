# Deepfake Image Classification

For more details, please refer to the documentation included in this repository.

## Project Overview

This project addresses a multi-class image classification challenge focused on detecting deepfake images generated by deep generative models. The goal is to train models capable of classifying images into one of five classes based on the given dataset.

## Dataset

- **Training set:** 12,500 images with labels (`train.csv`)  
- **Validation set:** 1,250 images with labels (`validation.csv`)  
- **Test set:** 6,500 images without labels (`test.csv`)  
- **Sample submission:** Provided as `sample_submission.csv`

## Models

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- Used as a baseline reference model due to its simplicity and minimal training requirements.  
- Classification based on image histograms.  
- Experiments showed the influence of the number of bins, distance metrics, and smoothing filters on performance.  
- Best accuracy obtained: **0.5904** (with 16 bins, Manhattan distance, Gaussian smoothing, and k=35).  
- Although stable and interpretable, accuracy was insufficient for competition submission.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

- Selected for its ability to automatically extract spatial and texture features from images.  
- Data augmentation techniques used: flip, brightness, contrast, crop.  
- Final architecture includes residual blocks, convolutional layers, and L2 regularization.  
- Optimizer: Adam with CosineDecayRestarts scheduler and EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting.

## Model Variants and Performance

- Basic CNN (2 convolutional layers + max pooling + dense): accuracy ~**0.7376**.  
- Improved CNN with augmentation, L2 regularization, dropout, batch normalization: accuracy ~**0.8504**.  
- CNN with learning rate scheduler (CosineDecayRestarts): accuracy ~**0.8720**.  
- Final model with residual blocks achieved the best performance: accuracy ~**0.9224** on validation.

## Final Results

- The final CNN model was chosen for submission due to surpassing the 0.9 accuracy threshold.  
- Achieved test accuracy in Kaggle competition: approximately **0.9208**.
